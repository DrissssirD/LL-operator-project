The provided C code implements a basic telephone directory management system using a linked list data structure. The program allows users to perform various operations on the telephone directory, including sorting entries by number or name in ascending order, inserting new entries, searching for entries by name, and deleting entries by number.

The program reads input data from a file named telephone.txt, where each line represents an entry in the directory, containing the telephone number, first name, and last name. Upon execution, the program loads the data from the file into the linked list, creating a linked list node for each entry.

The main menu offers options for the user to perform different actions on the directory:

Ascending Sort: Users can sort the directory either by telephone number or by full name (first name and last name) in ascending order. The sorted directory is then displayed on the screen.

Insertion: Users can add a new entry to the directory by providing the telephone number, first name, and last name. The new entry is inserted into the linked list at the appropriate position to maintain the ascending order based on the telephone number.

Search: Users can search for an entry in the directory by providing the first name and last name. If the entry is found, its details (telephone number, first name, and last name) are displayed on the screen.

Deletion: Users can remove an entry from the directory by specifying the telephone number. If the entry is found, it is deleted from the linked list, and the updated directory is displayed.

The program continues to display the main menu until the user chooses to exit (option 0). Note that the program does not store the sorted directory permanently; it reloads the original data from the telephone.txt file before each operation.

The code demonstrates basic file handling, linked list manipulation, and various C programming concepts. To extend the functionality or improve the program's efficiency, one can consider implementing additional features like file saving, error handling, or menu enhancements.

Overall, the provided C code offers a simple and functional telephone directory management system using a linked list data structure.
